Your task is to design and build an Android application that will allow a user to find eatery hygiene information using the FSA’s API.

Searching

- Ignore businesses that are labelled as being exempt from having a rating.
- a one-press ‘local search’ based solely on their current location as identified by their device.
	- available in initial activity
	- diplays the 15 establishments closest to the user,
	- ... ranked by distanced.
- ‘simple search’ TextView search bar.
	- available in initial activity
	- Queries by place (e.g., "Birmingham")
	- or by business name (e.g., “Dave’s Tasty Cafe”)
- 'Advanced Search'
	- Search by business name (TextView input)
    - By the type of business (as returned by GET BusinessTypes in the API).
    - By the rating that an establishment has (e.g., only establishments with a 5 rating).
    - By region and a local authority.
    	- You should use spinners for this. For instance, a user should be able to select “Scotland” as the region and then “Aberdeen City” as the local authority.
    	- These should be retrieved using the GET Authorities and GET Regions API calls.
    - Use location instead of spinners
    	- control the radius of their search in miles. (Hint - read the API endpoint documentation carefully.)
- gracefully handling of no results.
- clear that a search is under way.


Presenting

2 ways of presenting this information.

- List of results
	- all searches should initially be displayed in a list form
	- sortable by
		- the hygiene rating 
		- the date that the rating was awarded
		- if search based on location, by distance
	- able to select an establishment for more details, including:
		- the type of business
		- its full address
		- the Authority responsible for rating it
		- and the contact email address for the authority responsible for rating it.
		- the location of the establishment on a map.
- Map
	- pins for each establishment
	- When the user clicks the marker, it shows the individual information for that establishment.

The FSA API
- v2 of the API
	- x-api-version must be set to 2
- constrain data requests for speed
